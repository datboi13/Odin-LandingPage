Basic Landing Page </br>
Live Demo => https://eddieboi13.github.io/Odin-LandingPage/ </br> </br>
This was my first major project while studying th Odin Project's curriculum. It deepened my understanding of many fundamental css properties, namely flexbox. </br> </br>
It displays a little bit of the love I have for sports, as well as some basic design patterns given by the Odin Project.
